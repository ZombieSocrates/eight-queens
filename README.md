# eight-queens
Just some code for trying to solve the [eight queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). The main solution I'm interested in experimenting with now is a Constraint Satisfaction approach detailed in Chapter 6 of [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)
